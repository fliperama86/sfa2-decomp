# Port

Groundwork for a port of the game to macOS on Apple Silicon, Windows and
Linux. **Nothing of the game compiles or runs on any of them.** This folder
holds the decisions taken so far, one pinned dependency and one check of that
dependency. It changes nothing under `ps1/`.

The rule for a port is in the [requirements](../docs/requirements.md): the
game code stays as close to the original as possible, only Sony's library
code is swapped, and what game code cannot keep on another machine goes
behind build switches and is listed. No build switch exists yet.

## Decisions

By the owner, on 2026-10-06:

- The targets are macOS on Apple Silicon, Windows and Linux, from one source.
- The port has a worktree and a lane of its own, apart from the matching work.
- The replacement of Sony's library is the first piece.
- That replacement is [PsyZ](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/psyz), used as a
  dependency. It is not written here and not copied here.

A direction, not a ruling. Nothing is built on it:

- The game's tables hold PS1 addresses, four bytes each, and all three
  targets have eight-byte addresses. The sotn-decomp project, which uses
  PsyZ, has no stand-in for PS1 memory: its tables are C that its matching
  build checks byte for byte, so a host compiler gives them host addresses,
  and pictures and the like are read from files of the player's own disc
  or made into source from it when building. The recommendation put to the
  owner was to go the same way when the tables of this game are C, which
  nearly all are not yet (the plan lists ownership of game data as not
  accomplished), and not to decide before the library work needs it. The
  owner went on to the library.
- The other way that was discussed: one block of memory that stands in for
  the PS1's, loaded from the disc, with every stored address translated
  where game code follows it. It needs no table in C, and it touches game
  source at each such place.

## The dependency

PsyZ replaces the PSY-Q library, so that source written against it compiles
for other machines. It is a submodule at `external/psyz`, pinned to commit
`4e4b3e8dc7ae740c085fd190d635f54142d2d552`. A submodule records an address
and a commit: no file of PsyZ is in this repository.

Its `LICENSE` file at that commit gives three terms: MIT for its samples
and its test framework, among others; MPL 2.0 for its own two source
folders; and "Unlicensed" for its header folder and for a source folder
that the tree at that commit does not have. Its folder of decompiled
library code carries an MIT file of its own. The owner was told on 2026-10-06 that the headers carry no license and
decided to use PsyZ as a dependency.

Its porting guide asks of game source, among other things: its types for
ordering tables and for the first word of a primitive, no fixed addresses,
no symbols that overlap, and no address kept in a 32-bit integer. Each is a
build switch in the sense of the requirements when it is made.

## The check

```sh
port/tools/check_psyz.sh [--headless] [BUILD_DIR]
```

It fetches the submodule and the SDL source that PsyZ builds against, builds
PsyZ's own test suite and runs it one area at a time. It needs git, a C and
a C++ compiler, CMake 3.21 or later and Ninja; the last two can come from
`pip install cmake ninja`. `--headless` is for a Linux machine
without the development files for windows, graphics and sound. `BUILD_DIR`
is taken from the folder the script is called from; without it the build
goes to `port/build/psyz-tests`, which Git ignores.

What ran, on 2026-10-07, on one Linux machine of that kind, x86-64, with
`--headless`: the library and its tests build, and the script printed

```
bu: ztest: 7 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
dither: ztest: 0 passed, 10 failed, 0 skipped
events: ztest: 66 passed, 10 failed, 1 skipped
gpu: ztest: 5 passed, 32 failed, 0 skipped
gte: ztest: 133 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
horizontal_grid: ztest: 1 passed, 3 failed, 0 skipped
libcd: ztest: 14 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
libcd_playback: ztest: 3 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
path_adjustment: ztest: 7 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
spu: ztest: 45 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
spu_malloc: ztest: 3 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
truncation: ztest: 3 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
all: ztest: 287 passed, 55 failed, 1 skipped
```

and ended with status 1, as it does when any area fails. The three areas
that compare drawn pictures mostly fail there: the pictures that were
looked at came out black, on a machine that has nothing to draw with. Ten
tests of timer events fail too, and why was not looked into.

What this shows: PsyZ builds from the pin on one Linux machine, and its
tests of the disc, the sound chip, the memory card and the arithmetic pass
there. What it does not show: a window, a drawn picture, sound from a
speaker, macOS, Windows, or anything about the game. With the real suite
the script has not been seen to end with status 0 anywhere.

```sh
port/tools/check_psyz_controls.sh
```

runs the script against stand-ins for git, CMake and the test program, so
nothing is fetched or compiled: a fresh checkout with the default folder, a
relative and an absolute folder, `--headless`, and each of the statuses 0,
1 and 2. Its last line on 2026-10-07 was `controls: 15 of 15 as expected`.
It says nothing about PsyZ.

## Not decided

- How game units reach the library. They call it by address names, such as
  `func_80157fc4`, and PsyZ has the library's own names.
- Which of the library functions that the game calls PsyZ lacks or only
  stubs. A comparison by name was made by hand once and is not a published
  tool; no count from it is given here.
- The build of the game side for a host, and where it is checked on all
  three systems.
